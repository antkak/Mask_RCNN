## Mask R-CNN for Object Detection, Segmentation, and Tracking

Multiple Object Tracking using the Matterport implementation of [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow as a Detector. This repository is intended to extend and boost the functionality of MaskRCNN in the context of object tracking in video sequences.

Under construction!
